# tfjs-models

This repository contains a face-landmarks-detection model. 
The model itself is less relevant but uses Mediapipe FaceMesh and contains some
mappings for general facial landmarks (corresponding keypoint indices for i.e the nose of a face).

It also contains a "mesh map" that displays all 468 keypoints on a 2 dimensional plane.
This is helpful to create a mapping from 468 to 68 keypoint representation, used in other research.
